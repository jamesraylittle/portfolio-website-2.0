            You probably know this by now, but my name is James Little. I have a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree in computer science, and a minor in mathematics from Texas Tech University.
            I am currently a senior software developer \ application engineer, in research and development, for Brandon & Clark, Inc. in Lubbock, Texas.
            In my day job I wear a lot of hats. My day-to-day activites changes from project to project.

            I have been apart of writing several software applications for all types of machines, namely, desktop machines, embedded computers, Siemens programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and microcontrollers.  
            I have designed printed circuit boards (PCB) for production uses cases, and development use cases. 
            I have also designed electrical control cabinets.

            In Feburary of 2022, I became a husband to an incredible woman, and I also become a dad to a beautiful little girl.
            I think it goes without saying, I have been pretty busy these last couple of years. I am just now starting to find time to work on some personal projects, like this website!

            I have not touched web technogies in a long time, so I wanted to put together a little protfolio website to (1) make sure I still knew my way around web development, 
            (2) to attempt to showcase who I am as a technologist for potiental employment oppturnities. This website is built using Bootstrap, jQuery, and some help from Font Awesome. 
            I wanted to make something super simple, but extendable. So I created a small Single Page Application. It loads an HTML page based on the query string, from the pages directory.
            I was using the hash mark at the end of the url to determind which page to load, but I found it difficult to include page ancors, like the ones on my resume page, which lead me to use the query string.
            You can find the source code, pretty or not, at the <a class="small-link" href="https://github.com/jamesraylittle/portfolio-website-2.0">GitHub repository</a>.
