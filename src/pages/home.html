					My name is James Little, I am a simple individual who enjoys complexity. <br />
					I am currently working as a Senior Software Developer \ Application Engineer in Lubbock, Texas.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am passionately curious about computers, software, electrcity, and electrionics. I believe that function should come before form, and tabs are superior to spaces.
					I enjoy, and want to build useful things.
